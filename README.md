### Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Iâ€™m Simone Paloschi, a passionate developer with a strong foundation in mathematical engineering, computational learning, and problem-solving âœ¨. My repository is a showcase of my journey into machine learning, numerical methods, and software development. Below, youâ€™ll find a glimpse into some of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of:

Explore **machine learning innovation** through my [Neural Networks Development](https://github.com/Palpal16/NeuralNetworksDevelopment), where Iâ€™ve built and optimized models to solve classification challenges. For a deeper dive into coding fundamentals, my [C++ Neural Network](https://github.com/Palpal16/CppNeuralNetwork) project illustrates the inner workings of neural networks from scratch.
Additionally, I participated to a [datathon challenge](https://github.com/Palpal16/DatahonML), developing an **Automated Valuation Model (AVM)** for property prices using a large real estate dataset.

On the computational side, Iâ€™ve tackled efficiency and scalability with the [Poisson Parallel Solver](https://github.com/Palpal16/PoissonParallelSolver), leveraging C++ and MPI for high-performance numerical solutions.

You can also find my **LaTeX projects** in the [Lecture Notes repository](https://github.com/Palpal16/LectureNotes). It features lecture notes, summaries, and exam preparation documents written with precision and in an advanced style, showcasing my organizational and documentation skills.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out! Iâ€™m always looking forward to learning and collaborating. ðŸ˜Š
